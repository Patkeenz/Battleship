# Battleship

  This program is a one person battleship minigame made in my first object oriented programming class. The console demands the user to input the locations of their ships (each ship takes up one coordinate) and grenades (ships and grenades occupy one coordinate). The computer then places its own ships and grenades, and then the game goes on until one party has all it's ships hit/sunk. The program was written in Java on the eclipse platofrm.
